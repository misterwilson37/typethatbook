// ============================================================
// Tentacalendar — queue.js
// Version 1.1.0
//
// Pure scheduling logic: priority, pipelines, week and clock geometry,
// holidays. Has never known Firestore exists — that is why it is testable.
//
// RECENT:
// 1.1.0 — OUTRIDERS. `isOutrider` / `splitOutriders`: a stage whose computed
//          date falls outside [startDate, endDate] is not a pipeline step,
//          it is a task. Pure predicate only — store.syncOutriders does the
//          writing. projectPipelineWindow now collapses toward the project's
//          own dates, which is the intended consequence and not a regression.
//          ⚠️ An UNDATED stage is never an outrider, nor is any stage of a
//          timeless project: null means "not on the calendar", not "outside".
// 1.0.0 — FIRST STABLE. Not a rewrite: a declaration. This file has run a
//          real person's day since Katie migrated on 2026-08-02, and 0.y.z
//          means "the shape may still change," which stopped being true.
//          Five DEAD functions removed in the same breath, because a 1.0
//          promises an API and these were never part of one:
//            · getDeadlineHour, getClearDeckThreshold — setters got wired,
//              getters never did. Both values are read through the module
//              locals by the functions that need them.
//            · isWeekend, addWeekdays, weekendNeighbors — pre-D60 Mon–Fri
//              wrappers. D60 replaced the weekend CONCEPT with per-tier
//              allowedDays (isDayAllowed / addAllowedDays / allowedNeighbors)
//              and these three were left behind describing a rule the app no
//              longer has. Nothing called them, here or anywhere.
//          WEEKDAYS is no longer exported — it survives as the Mon–Fri
//          default inside allowedSet, which is its only remaining reader.
// 0.21.0 — A DATED TASK NO LONGER VANISHES ON ITS TIER'S OFF DAY. D61's
//          `continue` dropped it from active AND waiting AND everything —
//          a Work task dated to a Saturday existed in Firestore and appeared
//          on no screen, silently returning Monday as overdue. D61's intent
//          (Work must not nag on a Saturday) is kept; it now goes to WAITING
//          carrying `offDay: true` so the UI can say why. "Don't nag" and
//          "cannot be reached" are different things.
// 0.20.0 — see CHANGELOG.md.
//
// ⚠️ Full version history is in CHANGELOG.md. Keep this header SHORT —
//    it grew to hundreds of lines, which is how the banner and the
//    constant below drifted apart four times. The constant sits on the
//    next line on purpose: you cannot edit one without seeing the other.
//    Verify with `node version-check.mjs` before handing anything over.

/**
 * D88 — THE WEEK. Seven (or N) honest days plus the two spanning strips.

 * column: expiry, D61 off-day tiers, escalation slots, the D86 piles and
 * the whole sort come along for free. What this adds is everything that
 * only exists ACROSS days.
 *
 * PROJECTS DO NOT REPEAT DOWN THE COLUMNS. D48 rides a project through
 * every day of its pipeline window, which is right for "what could I
 * touch today?" and wrong for a week — a 3-month project would render in
 * all seven columns. So a stage row appears ONLY on the day its deadline
 * actually lands (plus today, if it's expired — a missed thing must not
 * vanish just because we changed views). The project's SPAN lives in the
 * top strip instead, where a span belongs.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   days[]        — { dayStart, isToday, isPast, items, load, passedEvents }
 *   projectSpans  — bars for the top strip, with stage pips per day index
 *   bannerSpans   — all-day events as one bar each, not one pill per day
 * Both span lists carry fromIdx/toIdx CLIPPED to the window, plus
 * clippedLeft/clippedRight so the UI can show "this continues offscreen"
 * rather than lying about a start date.

// 2h to each side of midnight, not a guess about which day "owns" it).
//
// Deliberately NOT built around "calendar year" vs "fiscal year" as a
// setting anywhere: Jake's question to Katie was left open, and the
// answer turned out to be "don't ask — let the range be arbitrary."
// Month/quarter/year buckets step FORWARD from the range's own start
// date (via addMonths, so day-of-month clamps and leap years are
// already handled) rather than from a calendar epoch. Start a range
// Jan 1 and you get calendar quarters/years for free; start it Jul 1
// and you get fiscal ones — same code, no branch, no setting to be
// wrong about. Any other custom range (a specific engagement's window,
// a stretch of months) works exactly the same way.
